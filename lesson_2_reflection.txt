What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
-> When you initialize a repository, a .git file is created and your current directory becomes master. We need to do it keep track of our changes in form of commits

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Staging area is different from working directory and the repository bcuz it specifies only chose files which must be included in the commit. It can help us make logical commits.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
We can make different logical changes in different files but only stage the relevant ones. So that we can commit only the files per logical change
