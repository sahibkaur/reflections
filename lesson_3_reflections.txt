When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all the work local?
->There can be many reasons but a very prominant reason could be when more than one persons are collaborating on your work.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
->Forks: forking is cloning the repository but on github itself.
clones: the exact copy of the repository is moved to anywhere you want, like you can copy it from local to local, remote to local
Branches:Well branch is just like copying code to make other version of it but you don't want to have a direct impact of it on the master branch and want to merge it to master once all the required changes are made.
